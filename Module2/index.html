                <h2>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</h2>
                <p>
                	At first glance this might seem like any other ordinary work place sit-com but as you keep watching you realise it much more than just a show creating comic scenes to please its audience. Brooklyn Nine-Nine revolves around the happenings of the 99th precinct and comprises of a crew of a varied range of ethinicities, sexualties and mindsets and captures a fun slice of their life in each 20 min episode of the show. The protagonist Jake peralta played by the beloved Andy Samberg who entertained audience for years previously on SNL leaves the audience wanting for more of his take on life and his humour.Each episode tickles your funny bone and overall the show is very light hearted and gives the viewer a sense of ease after watching.Words cannot capture the beauty of the script of the show written by Michael Schur, I would recommend anyone who is longing for a good laugh and warmth in heart to watch this show. You won't be disappointed.

                <h2>The Good Place</h2>
                <p>
                	Another one of Michael Schurs' beauty , The good place revolves around the concept of after life and what happens when different people from different backgrounds end up together in the good place i.e. the equivalent of heaven. The Good Place is treat for the person for being a good soul through out his mortal life and is filled with all the "good" things one can ever think of , but there is something wrong as Eleanor a resident of Good place is apparently a mistake. Filled with plot twists the biggest one at the end of Season 1 , the good place is a 4 season long show that leaves us with questions after each episode. Although the show itself is a fantasy the concept of good moral and becoming a better person even after death makes us think of the deeper meaning of life and death.The Good place is an unique show with literally an out of the world concept and is a great show to binge-watch this quarantine.

                <h2>Fresh Off the Boat</h2>
                <p>
                    Set in the Ninties ,Fresh off the boat revolves around the Huangs , a chinese-american family who move into the suburbs of Florida. The show is about the daily life of the Huangs and it honors the chinese traditions of the family while mixing in the americaness in their existance which makes it a chaotic , light hearted show. After watching the show we unknowingly end up thinking like the Huangs in our daily life. It is family centred show and a must watch if you are away from your family and missing them right now!
